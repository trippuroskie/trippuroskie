- 👋 Hi, I’m @trippuroskie

- 👀 I’m interested in learning about basically everything. I'm also interested in getting outside whether it be snowboarding, biking, trail running, hiking, climbing or surfing.
        I'd like to be able to live a life balanced with technology and the nature world.
        
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, CSS, HTML, javascript, DAX

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically any entry-level project that could help refine my skills and teach me new abilities.

- 📫 You can reach me through private messaging on Github... I think this is a thing?
